Business Problem: 
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. 
Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use.
Consequently, lower cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

Research Question: 
1.What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations? 
2.How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better? 
3.How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions? 

Hypothesis: 
1.More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2.When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently. 
3.The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservation.

While making this project i have used python and its libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
